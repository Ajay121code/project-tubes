## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React(upto suraj)
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT
- Testing: Jest
- Deployment: Docker/ or github pages(for sample)

## Project Structure
- `client/`: Contains the React frontend application (taken care by suraj)
- `server/`: Houses the Node.js/Express backend
- `models/`: Defines MongoDB schemas
- `routes/`: API route definitions
- `controllers/`: Business logic for handling requests
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both client and server
3. Set up environment variables
4. Start the development server

## Development Approach
1. **Project Planning**: We started with defining user stories and creating wireframes
   - Reason: To ensure a clear vision and roadmap for the project

2. **Frontend Development**: We chose React for its component-based architecture and robust ecosystem
   - Key implementations: Responsive design, state management with Redux, custom hooks for API calls

3. **Backend API Development**: We developed the backend using Node.js and Express
   - Reason: Fast development, large community support, and easy integration with frontend
   - Key implementations: RESTful API endpoints, middleware for authentication and error handling

4. **Database Design**: We opted for MongoDB due to its flexibility with document-based storage
   - Approach: Designed schemas for users, playlists, and videos

5. **Authentication and Security**: Implemented JWT for stateless authentication
   - Reason: To ensure secure user access and data protection

6. **Testing**: We used Jest for unit and integration testing
   - Approach: Wrote tests for critical components and API endpoints

7. **Deployment**: The application is deployed using Docker
   - Reason: Ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies scaling

## Features
- User registration and authentication
- Create, edit, and delete playlists
- Search and add YouTube videos to playlists
- Share playlists with other users
- View playlist statistics

## Future Enhancements
- Implement social features (comments, likes)
- Add support for other video platforms
- Develop mobile applications for iOS and Android
- Implement machine learning for video recommendations
